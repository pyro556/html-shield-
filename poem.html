    <h1>Mad About Cows</h1>
    <p>
        I've eaten part of a cow's heart<br>
        to become a part of the past,<br>
        of tio & his talk of grandpa's<br>
        love of tacos of the heart,<br>
        the eyes &amp; brain, the parts<br>
        of a cow that make one mad.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I've held a heart hacked to chunks<br>
        &amp; cooked on the grill in the backyard,<br>
        a warm corn tortilla cradling parts<br>
        of artery too hard to chew through<br>
        w/teeth not trained for the toughness<br>
        of the meat, the organ that once beat<br>
        in the body of a beast who feasted in grass.<br>
        <p>
            I've tried to taste a piece of the past,<br>
            of abuelo's craving for tacos de corazon,<br>
            ojos y cerebro pero two bites was enough<br>
            to feel what I felt it must've been like for him,<br>
            the flavor &amp; fullness, the forever chewing.<br>
        </p>
